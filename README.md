Minimal and Simple Deep Q-Learning implementation in Tensorflow Keras and Gym. Under 100 lines of code!

The explanation for the `dqn.py` code is covered in the blog article
[https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/](https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/)

## Install

It is convenient to install dependencies with [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```shell script
conda create -f env.yml
```

## Usage

Simply run the `dqn.py` script:

```shell script
